# Knights-Quest
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difficulty: Intermediate-Advanced

This introductory gaming project is from "Beginner's Step-by-Step Coding Course", written by DK Pub. This is a continuation of my career in software development and programming, following my graduation and certification from UC Berkeley's Data Analytics Extension Program. I felt that this project can help hone some of the fundamentals of programming in Python.

"Knight's Quest" is a two-dimensional game created using Python-PyGame. Players will navigate the game in a dungeon-crawler type format. The objective of the game is to obtain the key and unlock the door to advance. However, players must avoid running into walls and guards. Fail, and the program will cease. Good Luck!
